was personified for the ancient Greeks in the mythical figure of Pandora. According to legend, she was the first mortal woman, whose blazing curiosity set a chain  of earth-shattering events in motion. Pandora was breathed into being  by Hephaestus, God of fire, who enlisted the help of his divine  companions to make her extraordinary. From Aphrodite she received the capacity  for deep emotion; from Hermes she gained  mastery over language. Athena gave the gift of fine craftsmanship and attention to detail, and Hermes gave her her name. Finally, Zeus bestowed  two gifts on Pandora.
